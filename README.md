# FamilyNest

**FamilyNest** is a React Native application designed to help families stay organized, share tasks, and strengthen connections through efficient communication and task management.
This is my first attempt at using React Native with JavaScript, in the context of the course "Software-Engineering" ( Ariel-University) , the code is not perfect and some mistakes would have cost important time before 
submitting and presenting my app.
